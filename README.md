This project is still a work in progress however you can use it for some basic functionality such as getting the amount of characters, words and lines inside of all files in a directory.

To use this program, simply do the following:
dir-info (Directory path) (File extension)

Example:
dir-info my-awesome-game/src/ .c

That's it for now!
